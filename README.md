Q: Why is there a monthly subscription cost for the Pro version?
<br>

A: In order to fully dedicate to an environment that is constantly changing and to provide useful updates to the SMARTi dashboard and its automations, a monthly cost is needed to properly develop, run, test and deploy the solution.


# Installation

Prerequisites:

* ## This integration only supports Home Assistant 2024.8 and above. Installing and configuring this integration on a Home Assistant installation with a lower version than this will result in errors and the integration will not work properly.

Before starting your installation, make sure you have the two following lines in your configuration.yaml file:
<pre>
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages 
</pre>

# Manual Installation via HACS
Prerequisites

Ensure you have HACS installed and running in your Home Assistant instance.
Steps to Install

1. ## Add the SMARTi Repository
    - Open HACS in Home Assistant.
    - Go to Settings > Custom Repositories.
    - Add the repository URL:
    - https://github.com/Prosono/SMARTi_BaseComponent
    - Set the category to Integration and click Add.

2. ## Install SMARTi
    - Search for SMARTi in HACS.
    - Click Install.
    - Restart Home Assistant after the installation is complete.

3. ## Add the Integration
    - Navigate to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration in Home Assistant.
    - Search for SMARTi and select it.

4. ## Select Your SMARTi Version
    - Choose between SMARTi Basic or SMARTi Pro during setup.

5. ## Token and Email Requirements
    - SMARTi Basic: A token is automatically generated and sent to your email if you select "I do not have a token."
    - SMARTi Pro: A token must be purchased from our website:
    - Purchase SMARTi Pro Token
    - Upon successful payment, the token will be sent to your email.

NOTE: For some email providers the automatic token email will be blocked or put into your spam folder. If you do not receive an email with your token (Basic or Pro), try with another email address or reach out to us at support@smarti.dev so we can retreive and send you your token personally.     

6. ## Enter Your Token and Email
    - After selecting your SMARTi version, enter your token and email to proceed.

7. ## Choose Your Installation Mode
    - Automatic Installation:
    - Installs all required resources and switches Home Assistant to YAML mode.
    - Manual Installation:
    - Requires manual installation and configuration of resources. Refer to the Required Cards section below for details.

- ### Manual

If you select manual mode during the setup of the SMARTi integration, none of the required cards will be automatically downloaded from HACS. Instead, it will be the responsibility of the end user to install these cards manually, either by directly downloading them or by using HACS.

A complete list of the cards required for the SMARTi integration can be found in the "Required Cards" section at the end of this README. Please ensure that all listed cards are properly installed to fully utilize the SMARTi dashboard and its features.

- ### Automatic

If you select automatic mode during the setup of the SMARTi integration, it will automatically enable YAML mode for your Home Assistant installation and download all the cards required for the SMARTi dashboard.

Please note that enabling YAML mode changes the way resources are managed in your Home Assistant setup. By default, Home Assistant operates in storage mode, but with YAML mode enabled, any additional cards you download from HACS (or existing cards not included with the SMARTi integration) will not be active in your installation. **Also if you already have YAML mode enabled in Home Assistant somwhere in your configuration, you must select the manual mode!**

For a list of cards included with the SMARTi integration, refer to the "Included Cards" section at the bottom of the README. Be sure to follow this process for any extra cards you wish to use to ensure proper functionality.


This also means that the SMARTi integration takes full responsibility for managing the provided cards, including updating, adding, and removing them as needed.

For the best experience, we recommend using the automatic installation during the initial setup of the SMARTi integration to ensure everything is installed and configured correctly. If you encounter conflicts with pre-existing dashboards that use cards not provided by the SMARTi integration, you can uninstall and re-install the integration in manual mode to maintain compatibility with your custom setup.

## When uninstalling the integration ALL settings, files, dashboards, automations etc related to the SMARTi integration will be deleted and your installation will return to its original state. 

# Usage

So you have successfully installed the SMARTi dashboard! Congratulations!
<br>

You might notice that some text is quite dark and unreadable (if you are using the basic Home Assistant theme)

To change this, we will have to do the following:

1. I am used to changing my themes and I have several already installed:
You simply go into your personal Home Assistant settings and change your theme to one of the SMARTi themes. There are several versions included. Select the dark mode option. 

2. I have never used themes before

In your configuration.yaml file, add the following lines to the top of the configuration.yaml:

<pre>
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
</pre>

Restart your Home Assistant installation and then you simply go into your personal Home Assistant settings and change your theme to one of the SMARTi themes. There are several versions included. Select the dark mode option.


## How the dashboard works
SMARTi uses device locations (Areas) and the device domain (Light, switch, humidifier etc) to correctly populate your dashboard. 

## My devices are not showing
The SMARTi dashboard is dependent on correct placement of your devices (areas) and type of equipment. If you do not find that your devices are listed in the proper locations, please verify that the devices exist under the "Unassigned Entities" section under the Misc tab and that they are given the correct domain in Home Assistant.

Also, an entity cannot contain an "'" in its name, Like "Linda's Light", it must be named "Lindas Light" instead. 

## Have SMARTi **NOT** show devices/entities
If you prefer SMARTi to exclude certain entities from appearing on its dashboards, simply hide those entities in your Home Assistant settings. Once hidden, SMARTi will automatically exclude them from display, ensuring a more tailored and clutter-free experience. Make sure to refresh the page once an entity has been hidden in order to see the reflected changes. 

## Set up power measurement sensor
Since SMARTi uses a more general power sensor, this will have to be set by the user. This can be set under the settings page under "Dynamic Power Sensor". If no sensors are present here, click the button "Update Power Sensor List" And it will populate the list with all sensors having a power measurement and you can select the proper one for the correct power measurement.

## No Weather forecast in the dashboard 
The weather forecast is dependent on a sensor called "home" (forecast_home). If you do not have this entity, create one from the met.no integration under "Devices and Services" and simply name it "Home".

# Calendar
<br>
The Calendar Pro card finds all your available clanedars and displays the next events for the next 3 days. If you want the icons to appear you have 4 different options:

  - entity: calendar.calendar
    label: 💼

  - entity: calendar.work
    label: 🏢

  - entity: calendar.family
    label: 👪

  - entity: calendar.personal
    label: 🏠

In order for the Icons mentioned above to appear in your calendar on your dashboard, you need to re-name your clanedar to either "calendar.work", "calendar.calendar", "calendar.family" or "calendar.personal". 


## Go from Basic to Pro

If you have the Basic version installed and you have upgraded to the pro version, uninstall the SMARTi integration and re-install it selecting the "Pro" version.

# Dependencies:

The SMARTi integration does not require any additional integrations to function. However, to unlock its full potential and access advanced features, it is recommended to install the following integrations:

- ## Browser Mod
<br>
The Browser Mod integration enhances the functionality of SMARTi by enabling certain popups to operate as designed. Additionally, it plays a key role in monitoring and displaying active devices directly within the SMARTi navigation bar, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. While not mandatory, this integration is highly recommended for full feature compatibility. Simply install the Browser Mod integration from HACS and restart Home Assistant for this to take effect. 

- ## Alarmo
<br>
The Alarmo integration enables users to set up a customizable and feature-rich alarm system within Home Assistant. Fully integrated into the SMARTi ecosystem, Alarmo is a required component for the proper functionality of SMARTi’s alarm panels and alert systems. This seamless integration ensures that your security features are optimized and operate as intended, providing a reliable and user-friendly alarm solution. Simply install the Alarmo integration from HACS and restart Home Assistant for this to take effect. 

- ## Ping (ICMP)
<br>
By adding a ping sensor named "smarti_internet" in the Home Assistant UI, you can monitor your internet connection with detailed statistics. Additionally, this sensor provides a convenient status icon in the navigation bar, allowing you to quickly view the state of your connection at a glance.

How to set up the "smarti_internet" sensor:
  1. Go to "Settings" and then "Devices and services"
  2. Click on "Add Integration"
  3. Search for "Ping" and add "Ping(ICMP)"
  4. Host should be "8.8.8.8" and click "Submit"
  5. Head on over to the "Entities" tab and find your "8.8.8.8" ping sensor and open it.
  6. Click on the little cogwheel
  7. Rename the sensor to "smarti_internet" and save it
