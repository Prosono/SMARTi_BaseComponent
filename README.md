# Installation

Installation

Pre-requisties:

* This integration only supports Home Assistant 2024.8 and above. Installing and configuring this integration on a Home Assistant installation with a lower version than this will result in errors and the integration will not work properly.

Before starting you installation, make sure you have the two following lines in you configuration.yaml file:
<pre> homeassistant:
        packages: !include_dir_named packages  </pre>

Via HACS

Ensure you have HACS installed in your Home Assistant instance.
Add this repository as a custom repository:
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant.
   - Go to Settings > Custom Repositories.
   - Add the repository URL: https://github.com/Prosono/SMARTi_BaseComponent
   - Set the category to Integration and click Add.
   - Search for SMARTi in HACS and click Install.
   - Restart Home Assistant.
   - Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration in Home Assistant.
Search for SMARTi and select it.
   - You now have to select the SMARTi Basic or the SMARTi Pro option.
   - After that you now hae the following two choices:

### Manual

If selecting manual mode when setting up the integration, SMARTi will NOT download any of the required cards from HACS. This will have to be done manually by the end user. The cards required by the SMARTi integration is listed below

### Automatic

If selecting automatic mode when setting up the integraiton, SMARTi will enable .yaml mode for you Home Assistant installation and download all the cards required by the SMARTi dashboard. The also means that your Home Assistant isntalltion will now be in .yaml mode meaning that if you are to download more cards from HACS (or have other cards form HACS installed that is not included in the SMARTi integration), you will have to add theese manually to your configuration.yaml file after installing form HACS. 

#### Example:
Lets say that you want to download another custom card not included with the SMARTi integration - e.g the "lovelace-dual-gauge-card" you will then have to add the following line to your configuration.yaml:

<pre> url: /community_plugin/dual-gauge-card/dual-gauge-card.js 
      type: js  </pre>

What thsi also means is that the SMARTi integration is now repsonsible for maintining theese cards and keeping them updated, adding/removing them etc. 

# Dependencies:

The SMARTi integration does not reqire any integrations to function, but for the full potential usage, it is reccomended to install the following integrations:

- Browser Mod
This integration will allow for some popups to function as designed, but it is mainly used for looking into the active devices showing in the SMARTi navigation bar
