# Installation

Pre-requisties:

* ## This integration only supports Home Assistant 2024.8 and above. Installing and configuring this integration on a Home Assistant installation with a lower version than this will result in errors and the integration will not work properly.

Before starting you installation, make sure you have the two following lines in you configuration.yaml file:
<pre>
homeassistant:
    packages: !include_dir_named packages 
</pre>

# Installation via HACS
Prerequisites

Ensure you have HACS installed and running in your Home Assistant instance.
Steps to Install

1. ## Add the SMARTi Repository
    - Open HACS in Home Assistant.
    - Go to Settings > Custom Repositories.
    - Add the repository URL:
    - https://github.com/Prosono/SMARTi_BaseComponent
    - Set the category to Integration and click Add.

2. ## Install SMARTi
    - Search for SMARTi in HACS.
    - Click Install.
    - Restart Home Assistant after the installation is complete.

3. ## Add the Integration
    - Navigate to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration in Home Assistant.
    - Search for SMARTi and select it.

4. ## Select Your SMARTi Version
    - Choose between SMARTi Basic or SMARTi Pro during setup.

5. ## Token and Email Requirements
    - SMARTi Basic: A token is automatically generated and sent to your email if you select "I do not have a token." Note: The token expires after 30 days and must be renewed by reconfiguring the integration.
    - SMARTi Pro: A token must be purchased from our website:
    - Purchase SMARTi Pro Token
    - Upon successful payment, the token will be sent to your email.

6. ## Enter Your Token and Email
    - After selecting your SMARTi version, enter your token and email to proceed.

7. ## Choose Your Installation Mode
    - Automatic Installation:
    - Installs all required resources and switches Home Assistant to YAML mode.
    - Manual Installation:
    - Requires manual installation and configuration of resources. Refer to the Required Cards section below for details.

- ### Manual

If you select manual mode during the setup of the SMARTi integration, none of the required cards will be automatically downloaded from HACS. Instead, it will be the responsibility of the end user to install these cards manually, either by directly downloading them or by using HACS.

A complete list of the cards required for the SMARTi integration can be found in the "Required Cards" section at the end of this README. Please ensure that all listed cards are properly installed to fully utilize the SMARTi dashboard and its features.

- ### Automatic

If you select automatic mode during the setup of the SMARTi integration, it will automatically enable YAML mode for your Home Assistant installation and download all the cards required for the SMARTi dashboard.

Please note that enabling YAML mode changes the way resources are managed in your Home Assistant setup. By default, Home Assistant operates in storage mode, but with YAML mode enabled, any additional cards you download from HACS (or existing cards not included with the SMARTi integration) must be manually added to your configuration.yaml file after installation.

For a list of cards included with the SMARTi integration, refer to the "Included Cards" section at the bottom of the README. Be sure to follow this process for any extra cards you wish to use to ensure proper functionality.

#### Example:
If you want to download and use another custom card not included with the SMARTi integration, such as the "lovelace-dual-gauge-card", you will need to manually add the following line to your configuration.yaml file:

<pre>
lovelace:
mode: yaml
resources: 
    url: /community_plugin/dual-gauge-card/dual-gauge-card.js 
    type: js  
</pre>

This also means that the SMARTi integration takes full responsibility for managing the provided cards, including updating, adding, and removing them as needed.

For the best experience, we recommend using the automatic installation during the initial setup of the SMARTi integration to ensure everything is installed and configured correctly. If you encounter conflicts with pre-existing dashboards that use cards not provided by the SMARTi integration, you can uninstall and re-install the integration in manual mode to maintain compatibility with your custom setup.

## When uninstalling the integration ALL settings, files, dashboards, automations etc related to the SMARTi integration is deleted and your installation will return to its original state. 

# Usage

## Have SMARTi **NOT** show devices/entities
If you prefer SMARTi to exclude certain entities from appearing on its dashboards, simply hide those entities in your Home Assistant settings. Once hidden, SMARTi will automatically exclude them from display, ensuring a more tailored and clutter-free experience. Make sure to refresh the page once an entity has been hidden in roder to see the reflected changes. 

## Set up power measurement sensor
Since SMARTi uses a more general power sensor, this will have to be set. This can be set under the settings page under "Dynamic Power Sensor". IKf no sensors are present here, just click the button "Update power Sensor Lsit" ANd it will populate with all sensors haveing a power measurement and you can select the proper one. 

# Dependencies:

The SMARTi integration does not require any additional integrations to function. However, to unlock its full potential and access advanced features, it is recommended to install the following integrations:

- ## Browser Mod
<br>
The Browser Mod integration enhances the functionality of SMARTi by enabling certain popups to operate as designed. Additionally, it plays a key role in monitoring and displaying active devices directly within the SMARTi navigation bar, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. While not mandatory, this integration is highly recommended for full feature compatibility.

- ## Alarmo
<br>
The Alarmo integration enables users to set up a customizable and feature-rich alarm system within Home Assistant. Fully integrated into the SMARTi ecosystem, Alarmo is a required component for the proper functionality of SMARTi’s alarm panels and alert systems. This seamless integration ensures that your security features are optimized and operate as intended, providing a reliable and user-friendly alarm solution.

- ## Ping (ICMP)
<br>
By adding a ping sensor named "smarti_internet" in the Home Assistant UI, you can monitor your internet connection with detailed statistics. Additionally, this sensor provides a convenient status icon in the navigation bar, allowing you to quickly view the state of your connection at a glance.
