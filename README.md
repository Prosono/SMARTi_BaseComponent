Q: Why is there a monthly subscription cost for the Pro verison?
<br>
A: In order to fully dedicate to an enviroment that is constantly changing and to provide usefull updates to the SMARTi dashboard and its automations, a monthly cost is needed to properly develop, run, test and deploy the solution.


# Installation

Installation

Pre-requisties:

* ## This integration only supports Home Assistant 2024.8 and above. Installing and configuring this integration on a Home Assistant installation with a lower version than this will result in errors and the integration will not work properly.

Before starting you installation, make sure you have the two following lines in you configuration.yaml file:
<pre>
homeassistant:
    packages: !include_dir_named packages 
</pre>

Via HACS

Ensure you have HACS installed in your Home Assistant instance.
Add this repository as a custom repository:
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant.
   - Go to Settings > Custom Repositories.
   - Add the repository URL: https://github.com/Prosono/SMARTi_BaseComponent
   - Set the category to Integration and click Add.
   - Search for SMARTi in HACS and click Install.
   - Restart Home Assistant.
   - Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration in Home Assistant.
Search for SMARTi and select it.
   - You now have to select the SMARTi Basic or the SMARTi Pro option.
   - After that you now have the following two choices:


A SMARTi Basic token is generated and sent to you by email upon initial configuration when selecting "I do not have a token" and is valid for 30 days, this will have to be renewd manually after the token expires by setting up the integfration again. 

A SMARTi Pro token must be pruchased forom our website at https://www.smarti.dev/smarti-store/p/smarti-powerflow-xe7ft

After you have selected your SMARTi version and you have sucessfully entered your token and email, you will have the two following installation options:

- ### Manual

If selecting manual mode when setting up the integration, SMARTi will NOT download any of the required cards from HACS. This will have to be done manually by the end user manually or via HACS. The cards required by the SMARTi integration is listed below at the end of this readme.

- ### Automatic

If selecting automatic mode when setting up the integraiton, SMARTi will enable .yaml mode for your Home Assistant installation and download all the cards required by the SMARTi dashboard. This also means that your Home Assistant instalaltion will now be in .yaml mode ( it is set to storage mode by default) meaning that if you are to download more cards from HACS (or have other cards from HACS installed that is not included in the SMARTi integration - again, check the included cards at the bottom of the readme), you will have to add theese manually to your configuration.yaml file after installing from HACS. 

#### Example:
Lets say that you want to download another custom card not included with the SMARTi integration - e.g the "lovelace-dual-gauge-card" you will then have to add the following line to your configuration.yaml:

<pre>
lovelace:
mode: yaml
resources: 
    url: /community_plugin/dual-gauge-card/dual-gauge-card.js 
    type: js  
</pre>

What this also means is that the SMARTi integration is now repsonsible for maintining the supplied cards and keeping them updated, adding/removing them etc. 

We reccomend that you do the automatic installation for the initial installation of the SMARTi integration to verify that everything works as it should. You can always uninstall the integration and then re-install it in manual mode if some of your pre-existing dashboard are using cards that the SMARTi integration is not providing. 

## When uninstalling the integration ALL settings, files, dashboards, automations etc related to the SMARTi integration is deleted and your installation will return to its original state.

This integration will allow for some popups to function as designed, but it is mainly used for looking into the active devices showing in the SMARTi navigation bar
